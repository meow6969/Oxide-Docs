react-router but for [dreamland.js](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/dreamlandjs)

```js
import { Router, Route, Redirect } from 'dreamland-router'

new Router(
  <Route>
    <Route path="/feed" show={<Feeds />}>
      <Route path="/home" show={<TimelineView kind="home" />} />
      <Route path="/public" show={<TimelineView kind="public" />} />
      <Route path="/bubble" show={<TimelineView kind="timelines" />} />
      <Route path="/bookmarks" show={<TimelineView kind="bookmarks" />} />

      <Redirect path="" to="/feed/public" />
    </Route>

    <Route path="/notice/:id" show={<Notice />} />
    <Route path="/user/:id" show={<User />} />

    <Route path="/settings" show={<Settings />} />

    <Redirect path="/" to="/feed" />
    <Route path="*" show={<PageNotFound />} />
  </Route>
).mount(document.querySelector('#app')!)
```


## quick docs
- routes will match top down, more specific routes go at the top and your catchall 404 at the bottom
- `Route` is a container for routes, it can have a `show` prop which is either a dreamland element or a function `(path: string, pathparams) => Component<any>` that returns a dreamland element, which you might want to use if you don't want to construct it at launch
- `Redirect` is a route that will redirect to another route when matched, it has a `to` prop which is the path to redirect to. The `to` prop can also be a function `(path: string, pathparams) => string` that returns the path to redirect to
- path can contain url parameters such as `/user/:uid/post/:pid` which will be passed to the components as properties, or as an object in the `pathparams` argument of the `show` function (if it's a function)
```js

function Post() {
  useChange([this.uid, this.pid], ()=>{
    console.log('post changed', this.uid, this.pid)
  })
}


let router = new Router(
  <Route>
    <Route path="/user/:uid/post/:pid" show={<Post /> } />
  </Route>
)
```
- if the path contains a wildcard `*` it will match anything after that (useful for 404 pages)
- if the path has subroutes, the matched subroute will be passed to the parent route's component as the property `outlet`
```js

function Home(){ 
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home</h1>
      <Link href="/home/settings">Settings</Link>
      <Link href="/home/feed">Feed</Link>


      <div>
        {use(this.outlet)}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

let router = new Router(
  <Route>
    <Route path="/home" show={<Home />}>
      <Route path="/settings" show={<Settings />} />
      <Route path="/feed" show={<Feed />} />
    </Route>
  </Route>
).mount(document.querySelector('#app')!)
```
- the root component can have a `show` property so that outlets can be rendered
- you can use the `Link` component to navigate to a route. Link is a *leaky component* meaning that it is affected by outside css
- you can call `router.navigate(path: string)` to manually go to a route
