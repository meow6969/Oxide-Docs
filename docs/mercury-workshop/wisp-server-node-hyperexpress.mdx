# wisp-server-node HYPEREXPRESS VERSION!

A [wisp protocol](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/wisp-protocol) server implementation, written in NodeJS.

This version has a feature called REALLY BAD MEMORY LEAK, under simple-wisp-client it gets to and stays at 10.2 GB memory usage, gotta love it!
### Usage ✨

This one is not drag and drop to bare server node, if you want that, use the [Normal wisp-server-node](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/wisp-server-node)

Simple usage is pretty simple
```js
Router.ws('/*', {
    idle_timeout: 60,
    max_payload_length: 32 * 1024,
    message_type: "Buffer"
}, (ws: HyperExpress.Websocket) => {
    wisp.routeRequest(ws);
});
```


wisp-server-node doesn't need to handle regular requests, just upgrade events.

### Is it fast? 🚀

its pretty fast, at leaking memory!

### Is it API stable? 🐎

no!

### Is it stable stable? 🐎🐎

Not in the slightest, it literally leaks gigs of memory
