# serverguard

An open source alternative to Double Counter. Known within the Titanium Network community as "Cybermonay" or "Proxyguard".
Created in response to mistrust of DC's development team as well as a desire to put control of network data back in the hands of our users.

# Setup
```shell
git clone https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/serverguard # download serverguard
cd serverguard
npm install -g bun
npm install
DISCORD_TOKEN="<discord bot token here>" npm start
